# Concordance2

Created data analysis program in Python that takes input text files and alphabetically sorts them via concordance  

Concordance is, essentially, a way of indexing text by alphabetically sorting principle words within the context of their respective lines. For data analysis, it makes it useful to see context because it gives information on how the author uses this word, not just how often.
